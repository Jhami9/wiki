# Checklist when first starting out 

- Check out the "Essential Info" wiki page 

- add yourself to the baron-lab outlook group to receive group emails. Group meetings are also added to the calendar associated with that group.
    - If you are in outlook on your desktop, scroll to the bottom of the mailbox and you will see a groups tab. Right click and browse and you can add to them.
    - Outlook on the web you will find it under the people section. Images are attached to show you what it would look like. When searching for more groups most of them can be found searching for rri or Robarts.

- Your department should have given you instructions to set up your UWO identity. It is used for many things (email, server access, etc)

- If he has not done it, remind CB to: 
    - email Rebecca Nash (rnash@robarts.ca) to get Robarts building access. She will also give you other useful information.
    - make a ticket with IT to add you to RRI-U-Baron group to give access to servers and datashare (UWO credentials)
    - email Igor (isolovey@robarts.ca) to get access to git.cfmm.robarts.ca with (UWO credentials)
    - add you to slack 

- request a "standard user account" for the CBS computational server. See [Computational Server Wiki](https://osf.io/k89fh/wiki/Computational%20Core%20Server/?view_only=8281493cc75d429285735c98c1267261)

- provide Dr. Baron with a picture and short statement about yourself so that he can add your profile to [https://baronlab.ca](https://baronlab.ca) (look at other profiles for examples)

- decide on a day for weekly one-on-one meetings with Dr. Baron. The purpose of this is to troubleshoot problems and to simply keep Dr. Baron informed of how things are going.

- turn on notifications for #baronlab and #general channels on slack, and whatever else is related to your project.

- If performing scanning for your project, get signed off on SOPs for access to CFMM MRI Facility (Appendix 3 at [https://cfmm.uwo.ca/resources/sops.html](https://cfmm.uwo.ca/resources/sops.html)).

# Working hours and location expectations
The Baron Lab supports a healthy work-life balance. 
- Trainees are requested to be present on-site during the “core hours” of 10 am to 3 pm as much as they can manage because face-to-face time with their peers is essential for creating a positive work atmosphere, improving mental health, building professional relationships, mentorship, and forming collaborations. 
    - If this is difficult for you, alternative arrangements are completely acceptable. Please discuss alternative arrangements with Dr. Baron. 
- Dr. Baron does not require trainees to ask for permission to take time off for single or partial days off. For longer vacations please notify Dr. Baron. 

# Authorship
Authorship on publications requires a meaningful contribution to its intellectual content, and author order is in order of decreasing contribution with the supervisor(s) appearing last. Note that even a contribution that required little time may still represent meaningful contribution. People that provided support that was not an intellectual contribution can sometimes be acknowledged in the "Acknowledgements" section (e.g., somebody taught you how to use software that you ended up using for the analysis, but they did not participate in the analysis/interpretation of data for the paper in question). Sometimes authorship is not clear-cut; if in any doubt please do not hesitate to contact Dr. Baron. Co-first-author is appropriate for collaborative work where multiple people had similar net contribution to the research.

# Feedback
Feedback to Dr. Baron about any lab policies are extremely welcome and encouraged. Anonymous feedback to Dr. Baron is welcome through a typed note slid under his office door.
