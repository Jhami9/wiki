## EDI
Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) is essential for achieving excellence in research. The best ideas come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences, but systemic barriers exist in academia and research. 

Members of the lab are expected to read this guide:â€¯[https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/nfrf-fnfr/edi-eng.aspx](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/nfrf-fnfr/edi-eng.aspx). While the focus is on grant applications, there is excellent information there.

The Harvard implicit association test can be rather eye-opening. Members of the lab are strongly encouraged, but are not required, to take the test: [https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/langchoice/canada.html](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/langchoice/canada.html) 

Please perform EDI training modules as they become available: [https://www.edi.uwo.ca/trainings-and-certificates/online-modules/](https://www.edi.uwo.ca/trainings-and-certificates/online-modules/)

## SGBA
Sex and gender differences are often overlooked in research. This oversight limits the generalizability of research findings and their applicability to clinical practice, in particular for women but also for men. 

Understanding the role of and how to perform sex- and gender- based analysis (SGBA) is essential for all members of the lab. CIHR has excellent resources for this. 

Trainees should familiarize themselves with the following paper on Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) Guidelines: [link to paper](https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s41073-016-0007-6)

All trainees are expected to go through the material in "How to integrate sex and gender into research" and "Impacts of integrating sex and gender in research" at [https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/50833.html](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/50833.html). The tabs in "How to integrate sex and gender into research" that are most relevant to the work in our lab are "Biomedical" and "Clinical". The other sections are recommended, but optional. The training modules at [https://www.cihr-irsc-igh-isfh.ca/](https://www.cihr-irsc-igh-isfh.ca/), while tailored toward grant reviewers, are excellent for all stages of researchers.
