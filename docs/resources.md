# MRI Physics
- C Baron has copies of [Principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging](https://www.lulu.com/shop/dwight-nishimura/principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging/paperback/product-22829760.html?page=1&pageSize=4) by Nishimura that trainees can borrow for short periods of time
  - It is not expensive (see link above), and buying a personal copy is not a bad idea.
